## ARC-LBB
This is a repository for ARC-LBB (Assessing the Risk of Crime in London Borough of Barnet), which aims to assess the risk of crime based on geographic places. 
The project has developed geospatial and classic machine learning models (regression, random forest, support vector machines) to best model the pattern of crime.
